WP-UNITED WordPress Integration Mod v0.9.5 RC1 for phpBB3
-----------------------------------------------
Last updated: 01 Deceber 2007, by John Wells

Check http://www.wp-united.com for latest versions, and for faster support

Thank you for downloading WP-United! This file introduces how to get up and running with your integrated phpBB & WordPress install.


BEFORE YOU BEGIN
------------------------

Make sure you have already installed phpBB and WordPress, and have verified that they are working OK. I recommend the latest versions - at this time of writing, that means phpBB3 RC2 & WordPress 2.2.1.

If these are not new installations, back up your phpBB & WordPress files and databases! WP-United is still in Beta - it could have bugs!

You have two options to install this mod. -- manually, by altering code in your phpBB files, or automatically, using EasyMod.



INSTALLING 
--------------

An install.xml file has been included. To read this properly, unpack the archive to your hard drive, and access the install.xml file from its unpacked location (it needs the accompanying .xsl file to display properly).

The  file will tell you which files to upload to your forum and where they should go, and will give instructions on which files to modify and how. 

Once you have completed those edite, look in the /templates folder, and apply the changes necessary for your installed themes. Some additional translations of user-facing strings have been provided in the /languages folder -- open up the .xml file for your language to install them.

If you need further help on what the directives mean, take a look at the phpBB forums -- http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=61611 . Make sure you back up your files before making any changes!

Once you have installed the mod, run the wpu-install.php file that you uploaded, and then delete it from your webspace. 

You should then be able to run the WP-United Setup Wizard, located under the WP-United tab in the phpBB Admin Control Panel.



UPGRADES
-------------

if possible, I will try to provide upgrade instructions for newer versions of WP-United. However, it is still in Beta and this cannot be guaranteed. Keep a copy of the install file for your records in case you need to refer to it in the future.



UNINSTALLING  (Noooo)
-----------------------------

We can't understand why you'd want to do this... but just in case, here goes: Uninstalling is easy. Just click the uninstall link in the Admin Control Panel. 


SUPPORT WP-UNITED   (*Please!*)
-------------------------------------------

Want to help improve the software? Or just want to put a smile on the developer's face? There are lots of ways you could help:
- Bug swatting -- Report any bugs you find on the forums. Anything, from typos to server crashes... let us have it!
- More Exposure -- Link back to www.wp-united.com, or post about WP-United on your blog. Want an interview? I'm available!
- Cash -- of the cold and hard variety. Every little bit helps. I don't have much...
- Translation -- translate this file and the language strings used in the mod. I'll put your name in lights (well, pixels) if you do.
- Cash --  Oh wait... 


**Thanks** To everyone who has donated so far.

HAPPY BLOGGING!
