Simple header and footer will work best for most WordPress themes – it is faster and less resource-intensive, but cannot display dynamic content on the forum page. However, if you want the WordPress sidebar to show up, or use other WordPress features on the integrated page, you could try 'full page'. This option could be a little slower."
