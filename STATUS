Current status:
- user integration is working bi-directionally
- Template integration works OK
- Cross-posting works but awaiting minor changes
- Widgets and template tags working OK
- Other options generally working but as yet not well tested.

------ Reported errors -----------
- Win server errors with file tree
- jQuery conflicts (should be fixed now)
- Incorrrect font size on rev int
- error on password change in phpBB


------ cross-posting and comments ---------
-- Add cross-posting permissions to an additional column in the user mapper -> permissions tab (?)
-- move cross-posting from per-topic to per-post (and topic!) to reduce query load
-- check excerpt/full settings are working
-- rework html-to-bbcode translation for images with captions
-- make wpu_get_xposted_details() cacheable, and implement a get_topic_url template tag. See http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2861 .
-- for each cross-posted comment insert a ghost comment into wordpress with a marker to the phpBB comment (? -- unless we can cleanly generate "comments list to load", see below)
-- override all WP comment loaders (e.g. including in ACP) to merge latest WP posts and phpBB comments into single array
-- consider allowing guest posting of comments (IF akismet is installed?).


----- panel general --------
-- re-implement "debug info to post" panel -- combine with debug class. Remove lDebug, change to wpuDebug and change in options.php
-- add plugin activate action that describes next steps in bubble
-- integrate phpBB ACP link into dashboard dropdown & menu
-- add plugin deactivate action that warns of consequences, and asks if they want a complete removal.
-- add deinstallation routine using ajax front-end so it can't crash out

---- general cleanup ----
-- check on Win servers
-- decide what to do with $phpEx global
-- append_sid is requiring to be fed the session ID -- why?
-- do check on plugin activation for php and wordpress version
-- Profile db queries on page load and integration, and cache commonly-pulled items (some phpbbForum->get_userdata calls pull multiple times). Also rely more on phpbb_userid if we can.
-- modify version.php to contain compatibility information
-- remove $compat from core-patcher
-- in plugin, only load necessary portions, and load phpBB late only if needed.
-- use common-lite.php for phpBB to remove unneeded options in admin (and potentially on WP pages).
-- LANG strings -- move back again to WP po/mo (arrgh - we ported them to phpBB in v0.8!)
-- check for caching plugin, esp. total cache & super cache, and check that they are handling phpBB cookie and not causing errors

----- template integration ------------
-- WPU cache not cleared on style changes [should be fixed]
-- re-enable wordpress-in-phpbb integration
-- When grepping <title>, check if more than one exists. If so, ignore any commented ones.

---- widgets --------
-- add username colours to topics, posts & loginuserinfo widget
-- login can use ajax->refresh with bidi integration (but still logs into phpBB)
-- other widget suggestions from forum
-- include gpl userblog widgets
-- Add forum selection/deselection option to widget control panel for latest posts and topics widgets


-------- user blogs --> wp-ms ----------
-- check permissions mapping and user creation -- add check for whether they should be given a blog or not when being created
-- check css magic / template voodoo with many different user blog templates at once. (or disallow/warn against wordpress-in-phpbb with wp-ms)
-- add back userblog permissions
-- reconnect blog buttons, consider removing blogid from phpBB
-- check where forum homepage gets added on multiple sites


--------- possible for future versions ---------------
-- increase cookie domain check to also check matching of cookie paths
-- sync avatar to phpBB as 'if gravatar' option?? Can likely leave to next version
-- Add user lookup to permissions mapping tab
-- Add pre-mod routines and scratch/plugins loader folder for plugins or premium options
-- Finish "advanced settings" panel page -- first see what options are around and whether still necessary
-- Override WP version check?
-- support custom post types with per-type cross-posting settings
-- add ability to send settings to WP-United.com for analysis/feedback (likely deferred til 1.0)
-- check that we at least load up with Buddypress
-- when connecting to phpBB, check version for compatibility

------- pie in the sky -----------
-- finish "post to blog" in phpBB, integrate with pressIt
-- search integration
-- Add AutoMod engine (may defer to v0.9.x > .0 if not trivial)


--------- v0.8x -> v0.9.0 migrator / upgrader --------------
These are comments from 2010: Below is too sophisticated TBH. Easier to just add check when settings are installed.

In order to ensure a clean break and new features and code, work on this is deferred until we have a solid v0.9x
Once that is ready to release, we need a migrator that can:

- run in phpBB and compile a list of actions before any settings are overwritten (or before files are changed in case they get errors)
- remove old settings in WP & phpBB
- remove old widget options
- remove a_wpu_manage permission
- remove ACP modules
- add new user table columns
- ensure meta::phpbb_userId and phpbb_userLogin exists for all integrated users, and not for unintegrated users
- migrate cross-posts to post marker system
- create ghost posts for cross-posted comments (if needed)
- auto-create wp-ms blogs for users with own blogs and move posts into them
- check for old files that should be deleted
- provide instructions for moving from blog.php to new system (or auto-detect the settings)




Other (older) things noticed that may no longer be relevant
---------------------

-- map custom WP roles to phpBB perms. (consider: When roles are changed, phpBB is updated?)
- move wp_change_username somewhere better
- consider manually doing make_clickable() on xposted comment text
- Last post time reported different from topic time
- Cross-posted post reported not read, even after reading
- $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] unreliable as source for path computation on open_basedir restricted servers
- ? author permalinks not working if author permalink with space in username
- wpu_get_xposted_details called multiple times on page view (comments_open, comment load). Result should be cached.
- Check "posts since last visit" algorithm
