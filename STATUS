current target: v0.9.2.2

COMMITTED FOR v0.9.2.2:

* NEW: Autologin / "Remember me" now mapped across between phpBB & WP when logging in.
* BUGFIX: Better handling of modified wp-config file by core-patcher, and fix for short PHP tag in processed code (should fix some errors on logout, profile update, etc.)
* NEW: Allow selection of fall-back templates for older WordPress themes with no page templates.
* NEW: template integrator can now handle absolute CSS URLs starting with /

ISSUES:
-------


* Allow user mapper to re-integrate users with integrated counterparts, dont show as integrated.

------ cross-posting and comments ---------

-- Move x-posting to its own tab, independent of user integration
-- Add cross-posting permissions to an additional column in the user mapper -> permissions tab (?)
-- rework html-to-bbcode translation for images with captions
-- implement a get_topic_url template tag. See http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2861 .

---- template tags -------
user profile block http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3279&p=12773


---- general cleanup ----
-- decide what to do with $phpEx global
-- do check on plugin activation for php and wordpress version
-- Profile db queries on page load and integration, and cache more commonly-pulled items 
-- remove $compat from core-patcher
-- check for caching plugin, esp. w3 total cache & super cache, and check that they are handling phpBB cookie and not causing errors

----- template integration ------------
-- When grepping <title>, check if more than one exists. If so, ignore any commented ones.
-- Odd themes that could do with better auto integration:
----- Arras
----- Templatic Video
----- Woo ?? (see fb)

---- widgets  --------
-- Add forum selection/deselection option to widget control panel for latest posts and topics widgets
-- Most active forum members widget
-- Most active posts / topics widget
-- phpBB word cloud

------ extras ---------
akismet for phpBB


-------- user blogs --> wp-ms  (v0.9 not contingent on this) ----------
-- check permissions mapping and user creation -- add check for whether they should be given a blog or not when being created
-- check css magic / template voodoo with many different user blog templates at once. (or disallow/warn against wordpress-in-phpbb with wp-ms)
-- add back userblog permissions
-- reconnect blog buttons, consider removing blogid from phpBB
-- check where forum homepage gets added on multiple sites


--------- possible for future versions ---------------
-- increase cookie domain check to also check matching of cookie paths
-- sync avatar to phpBB as 'if gravatar' option?? Can likely leave to next version
-- Add user lookup to permissions mapping tab
-- Add pre-mod routines and scratch/plugins loader folder for plugins or premium options
-- Finish "advanced settings" panel page -- first see what options are around and whether still necessary
-- support custom post types with per-type cross-posting settings
-- add ability to send settings to WP-United.com for analysis/feedback (likely deferred til 1.0)
-- check that we at least load up with Buddypress

------- additional features or 'extras' -----------
-- finish "post to blog" in phpBB, integrate with pressIt
-- search integration
-- use Akismet for phpBB antispam
-- WP media browser in phpBB posting



Other (older) things noticed that may no longer be relevant
---------------------

- consider manually doing make_clickable() on xposted comment text
- Last post time reported different from topic time
- Cross-posted post reported not read, even after reading
- ? author permalinks not working if author permalink with space in username
- wpu_get_xposted_details called multiple times on page view (comments_open, comment load). Result should be cached.
