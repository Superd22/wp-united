current target: v0.9.2.5

* NEW: Page is reloaded if WP-United manages to log in phpBB on a full-page phpBB-in-wordpress page after phpBB has already run.
* BUGFIX: PM popup spawned from nav header widget showing 404 error
* NEW: More panhandling options on the support page (sorry, but I really need it...)



TODO:
>> user "disappears" (apparently!) if username is changed from phpBB
>> style-fixer could become recursive now                                              

>> Core-patcher isn't generating correct string for some people (can't reproduce)
>> xpost with changed slug getting reposted as comment
>> Redirect in AJAX comment loading plugin http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=3427&start=15


* yoothemes: image URL redirection incorrect :/
* no need to run any xpost query on p-in-w full page
* Allow user mapper to re-integrate users with integrated counterparts, dont show as integrated.
* Add override to cross-posted text
* absolution theme
* mapper should repaginate after processing users if set to show integrated/unintegrated
* hot topics & unread posts widgets
* group who is online by online location
* restore_state should restore to foreground too
* warnings about wp_query in responsive...
* Check activation status
* Add generic page.php fallback for full-page option
* add alert if enable both auto-creates when curr user unintegrated

TODO (LARGER):
* user blogs in WPMU

Live reported bugs:
- w3 total cache doing nothing, wp super cache not detecting logged in status


Regressions:
* phpbb prosilver CSS line icon-home etc do not get template-voodoo-ized (perhaps line to long)?


------ cross-posting and comments ---------

-- Move x-posting to its own tab, independent of user integration
-- Add cross-posting permissions to an additional column in the user mapper -> permissions tab (?)
-- rework html-to-bbcode translation for images with captions
-- implement a get_topic_url template tag. See http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2861 .

---- template tags -------
user profile block http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3279&p=12773


---- general cleanup ----
-- decide what to do with $phpEx global
-- do check on plugin activation for php and wordpress version
-- Profile db queries on page load and integration, and cache more commonly-pulled items 
-- remove $compat from core-patcher
-- check for caching plugin, esp. w3 total cache & super cache, and check that they are handling phpBB cookie and not causing errors

----- template integration ------------
-- When grepping <title>, check if more than one exists. If so, ignore any commented ones.
-- Odd themes that could do with better auto integration:
----- Arras
----- Templatic Video
----- Woo ?? (see fb)

---- widgets  --------
-- Add forum selection/deselection option to widget control panel for latest posts and topics widgets
-- Most active forum members widget
-- Most active posts / topics widget
-- phpBB word cloud

------ extras ---------
akismet for phpBB


-------- user blogs --> wp-ms  (v0.9 not contingent on this) ----------
-- check permissions mapping and user creation -- add check for whether they should be given a blog or not when being created
-- check css magic / template voodoo with many different user blog templates at once. (or disallow/warn against wordpress-in-phpbb with wp-ms)
-- add back userblog permissions
-- reconnect blog buttons, consider removing blogid from phpBB
-- check where forum homepage gets added on multiple sites


--------- possible for future versions ---------------
-- increase cookie domain check to also check matching of cookie paths
-- sync avatar to phpBB as 'if gravatar' option?? Can likely leave to next version
-- Add user lookup to permissions mapping tab
-- Add pre-mod routines and scratch/plugins loader folder for plugins or premium options
-- Finish "advanced settings" panel page -- first see what options are around and whether still necessary
-- support custom post types with per-type cross-posting settings
-- add ability to send settings to WP-United.com for analysis/feedback (likely deferred til 1.0)
-- check that we at least load up with Buddypress

------- additional features or 'extras' -----------
-- finish "post to blog" in phpBB, integrate with pressIt
-- search integration
-- use Akismet for phpBB antispam
-- WP media browser in phpBB posting



Other (older) things noticed that may no longer be relevant
---------------------

- consider manually doing make_clickable() on xposted comment text
- Last post time reported different from topic time
- Cross-posted post reported not read, even after reading
- ? author permalinks not working if author permalink with space in username
- wpu_get_xposted_details called multiple times on page view (comments_open, comment load). Result should be cached.
