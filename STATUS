In progress
--------------

Migrate login integration to login-integrator.php
TODO:
- search for all $wpUtdInt->integrate_logins and remove (done)
- a define can be set for bypassing integrated login -- we don't want it to happen in user mapper, etc.
- fix login debug, move to new debugger class
- Remove reliance on overridden wp functions
- move wp_change_username somewhere better


Other changes
---------------------
- duplicate stylekeys config entries error
- when creating phpBB user account in usermapper, don't just do nothing silently if phpBB username doesn't validate
- relax wordpres username 'admin' restrctions -- map them to phpBB account in setup wizard

- add option to show post excerpt to posts / topics widget/tag (first 20 words)
- WP Super Cache is looking for WP cookie -- get it to check for phpBB cookie too, or set WP cookie on phpBB cookie set?






- post to blog button
- Migrate widgets to new syntax

- Last post time reported different from topic time
- Cross-posted post reported not read, even after reading

- Move authentication out to module, check with WP Super Cache
- Allow guest commenting
- add username colours to topics, posts & loginuserinfo widget

$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] unreliable as source for path computation on open_basedir restricted servers
? author permalinks not working if author permalink with space in username

wpu-plugin should halt if installLevel is < 10, or if version doesn't match, to prevent users from using WP-United  at all if they haven't got past Step 5 of the Setup Wizard.
wpu_get_xposted_details called multiple times on page view (comments_open, comment load). Result should be cached.
Check "posts since last visit" algorithm

Enhancements:
On install, if blank page or server 500, automatically run again with wp_debug options turned on
Add forum selection option to widget control panel for latest posts and topics widgets
user blogs: show only my posts for author or below: http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2063
WP dashboard recent comments integration with xposted comments
When grepping <title>, check if more than one exists. If so, ignore any commented ones.
