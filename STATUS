current target: v0.9.2.0



x-posting todo: 
* clear comment cache when posting xposted comments
* Need to move view permission check to later if possible, so counts aren't broken.
* Add post table columns for wpu_xpost_parent and wpu_xpost_guestxxx
* for guest posts, need to REMOVE POST=USERID AND ALSO do_action('set_comment_cookies', $comment, $user); on comments taken by phpBB. Also store user/post meta

Useful for comment panel in dashboard:
- hook: admin_comment_types_dropdown to show forum posts or normal, not both :-)
- hook: restrict_manage_comments and do_action( 'manage_comments_nav', $comment_status );

guest posting issues outstanding:
	-- we just die on a username that is already in use, when we should really display a nice msg
	-- e-mail and website don't get saved, and username gets sent back to WP as 'Anonymous'
	-- No checking for username or e-mail clashes in WP
	-- No checking for e-mail clashes in phpBB (we do check for username clash though)

x-posting superclass

COMMITTED FOR v0.9.2.0:

* NEW: Re-write of cross-posted comments. Cross-posted comments now appear in the WordPress comments widget and dashboard, interleaved with non-cross-posted comments
* NEW: Cross-posting re-written to match on topics rather than posts; more efficient and flexible. Old cross-posts will be automatically upgraded.
* NEW: Cross-posted comments (posted by guests) that are pending moderator approval in phpBB now show up in WordPress, with the appropriate "pending approval" message.
* NEW: The initial connection screen now falls back to manual path entry if your server has restrictions on scannng the document root
* NEW: You can choose to enter the phpBB path and document root manually, in case your phpBB root is under a different document root.
* BUGFIX: Users getting logged out of phpBB on full-page phpBB-in-WordPress
* WORKAROUND: Incorrect user integration flow when Ultimate TinyMCE (or similar plugins that set current user too early) are active.
* BUGFIX: Regression in avatars; default avatars getting syncd to phpBB rather than true Gravatars.
* BUGFIX: categories/tags & stats not showing up for some users if the same database user is used for phpBB & WordPress in some circumstances.
* BUGFIX: Initial connect screen was complaining about lack of phpBB MOD before even trying to connect
* NEW: More errors can now be passed through on the initial connect & settings screens: No more guessing what it is keeping you from installing.
* NEW / BUGFIX: The forum page title keeps getting reset back to "Forum" and the page creation date keeps updating.
* BUGFIX: Top navbar not correctly showing post name
* BUGFIX: Userdata cache not cleared on first integrated login to phpBB
* BUGFIX: $table_prefix was getting unset on phpBB-in-WordPress pages, upsetting some mods
* BUGFIX: Improve handling of double-byte characters when escaping cross-posted topic titles and user names in user mapper.
* ENHANCEMENT: Try multiple ways to initialise admin javascript, so it works even when other plugins with script errors halt JavaScript loading
* NEW: Lots more login integration debugging, so you can see what is causing login integration problems. Now works on WP pages and in admin too.
* NEW: Some more core rewriting and cleanup; the context switcher is now separated into its own parent class.

------ cross-posting and comments ---------

-- Move x-posting to its own tab, independent of user integration
-- Add cross-posting permissions to an additional column in the user mapper -> permissions tab (?)
-- rework html-to-bbcode translation for images with captions
-- implement a get_topic_url template tag. See http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2861 .

---- template tags -------
user profile block http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3279&p=12773


---- general cleanup ----
-- decide what to do with $phpEx global
-- do check on plugin activation for php and wordpress version
-- Profile db queries on page load and integration, and cache more commonly-pulled items 
-- remove $compat from core-patcher
-- check for caching plugin, esp. w3 total cache & super cache, and check that they are handling phpBB cookie and not causing errors

----- template integration ------------
-- When grepping <title>, check if more than one exists. If so, ignore any commented ones.
-- Odd themes that could do with better auto integration:
----- Arras
----- Templatic Video

---- widgets  --------
-- Add forum selection/deselection option to widget control panel for latest posts and topics widgets
-- Most active forum members widget
-- Most active posts / topics widget
-- phpBB word cloud

------ extras ---------
akismet for phpBB


-------- user blogs --> wp-ms  (v0.9 not contingent on this) ----------
-- check permissions mapping and user creation -- add check for whether they should be given a blog or not when being created
-- check css magic / template voodoo with many different user blog templates at once. (or disallow/warn against wordpress-in-phpbb with wp-ms)
-- add back userblog permissions
-- reconnect blog buttons, consider removing blogid from phpBB
-- check where forum homepage gets added on multiple sites


--------- possible for future versions ---------------
-- increase cookie domain check to also check matching of cookie paths
-- sync avatar to phpBB as 'if gravatar' option?? Can likely leave to next version
-- Add user lookup to permissions mapping tab
-- Add pre-mod routines and scratch/plugins loader folder for plugins or premium options
-- Finish "advanced settings" panel page -- first see what options are around and whether still necessary
-- support custom post types with per-type cross-posting settings
-- add ability to send settings to WP-United.com for analysis/feedback (likely deferred til 1.0)
-- check that we at least load up with Buddypress

------- additional features or 'extras' -----------
-- finish "post to blog" in phpBB, integrate with pressIt
-- search integration
-- use Akismet for phpBB antispam
-- WP media browser in phpBB posting



Other (older) things noticed that may no longer be relevant
---------------------

- consider manually doing make_clickable() on xposted comment text
- Last post time reported different from topic time
- Cross-posted post reported not read, even after reading
- ? author permalinks not working if author permalink with space in username
- wpu_get_xposted_details called multiple times on page view (comments_open, comment load). Result should be cached.
