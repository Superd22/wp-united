FIXED / COMMITTED for v0.8.1:
------------------------------

- Forum posts widget link  has extra .php (http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1938)
- Latest forum posts widget shows too many posts (http://www.wp-united.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1940&p=6217#p6217)
- xposted comments permission check incorrect (http://www.wp-united.com/posting.php?mode=reply&f=14&t=1929)
- force hook file to be loaded in wpu-install if cache has not been purged
- cross-posted posts that later become global announcements can now be edited/commented on



Deferred to v0.9:
----------------------
wpu-plugin should be handling login/logout, rather than $wpUtdInt. wp-login redirects will then be more reliable
Cache: WordPress version can be auto-filled -- and WPINC should be dynamic when calculating file path
Use phpBB hook file to include WordPress first, making scope always global
Remove need for blog.php by handling all function collisions is phpBB via the above
Store all sleeping phpBB vars in phpbbForum abstraction, move away from wp-integration-class for handling phpBB state
ACP: Ditch wizard, put settings page into 4 jquery ui tabs, with next/back buttons and a 
submit button on the 4th (or ensure all tabs read on first install).
ACP: Compatibility / Performance slider
Widgets: Add birthdays widget
Widgets: Add AJAX backend framework
style fixer: Try to pull page with fixed links from cache -- perhaps based on quick hash of header content? (unlikely)
Template funcs: Move more phpBB code to phpBB abstraction
Template tags / widget: phpBB "function bar"
Overall architecture: Plugin fixes extend more general compatibility class -- to allow for simple "compatibility slider" in v0.9
To allow for redirects on logout, buffer ucp.php via proxy file
Cache: Make core/template calls follow same structure as css magic / template voodoo
 ACP: split out "advanced" options to simplify install
 Plugin: JavaScript and CSS should be enqueued
 Plugin bugs: have_comments() is returning false when yaapc comments are enabled. Same issue when wpu-plugin is disabled, so may not be a wpu issue.
$_SID is not getting set, so append_sid() does nothing without forced param
