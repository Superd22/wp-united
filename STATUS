Actions remaining for release of v0.8
-------------------------------------------------
This is more of a general todo list so that I (John) can prioritise changes 
and stick to a release date. See code documentation for a full list of @todos. 
Al full list of bugs is in the forum bug tracker.
The "DONE" section only contains changes in the final run-up to release

TODO
--------



- Cross-posting: Finalise ACP options
- Cross-posting: Auto-link option replaced by "Use phpBB for responses to cross-posted blog posts"
- Cross posting: To add: Automatically cross-post all blog posts permissions entry
- Cross-posting: Fix dates

Cache: Core cache is being generated every time
Cache: WordPress version can be auto-filled -- it already knows the version filename
Cache: Everything should use filemtime checking where possible
Cache: Align all calls
Cache: Ability to purge. Auto-purge on wizard run
Cache: Cache log seems to under-report on occasion after cache is purged
Cache: Add .htaccess to package

Feeds: Not recognised as XML in Chromium

WordPress detection: Stop using config file

Widgets: Direct link to ACP no longer works with new phpBB form nonce

Plugin bugs: have_comments() is returning false when yaapc comments are enabled. Same issue when wpu-plugin is disabled, so may not be a wpu issue.

ACP: wpu-plugin copy doesn't need to look for magic verion variable, just use filemtime instead.

ACP: Settings page to fix and upgrade to AJAX split as with Setup Wizard
ACP: Reset not working
ACP: User mapping errors reported
ACP: remove header fix, and split out "advanced" options to simplify install
ACP: Cache purge
ACP: Ditch wizard, put settings page into 4 jquery ui tabs, with next/back buttons and a 
submit button on the 4th (or ensure all tabs read on first install).
ACP: Compatibility / Performance slider

Plugin: All post titles suppressed on full page integration
Plugin: WP Admin link not showing on full page reverse integration in sidebar
Plugin: Logout etc. links not showing in dashboard
Plugin: Remove v0.6x flat redirection to phpBB for user editing, go back to buffering the dashboard instead
Plugin: JavaScript and CSS should be enqueued
Plugin: Align (abstract) $connSettings and $wpSettings access methods
Plugin: All requires/includes to use $phpEx via phpBB abstraction
plugin: Disable use of $connSettings for paths -- make $phpbb_root_path global and use it everywhere

Template tags: phpBB "function bar"

Full page integration: Improve settings / include blank page or option to create one (see blank page plugin). Remove "hide pages" hack



CSS Magic: Add fixes for IE (6,7,8)
CSS Magic: Width of phpBB in Solostream WP-Genius


Plugin-fixes: Move class to base make-compatible class, and have plugins extend it. 
Then can move all edits in --  for now, the template-loader edits, but also leave ability to step into all WP code

Plugin-fixes: When making global, plugin globals can override some phpBB vars. In compat mode,
instead of making straight global, we should run them through a fn that checks if the var already exists, and if it does, adds them
to sleepingVars. May be best to first create phpBB abstraction to store them.

Styles: Default padding a little off (?)

User blogs: Check and improve dashboard

Under consideration:
Overall architecture: Remove subdomain restrictions
Overall architecture: Plugin fixes extend more general compatibility class -- to allow for simple "compatibility slider" in v0.9
Overall architecture: Script path, URL, etc. still too hard to calculate, messy
Overall architecture: General phpBB class for forum access from WP
Overall architecture: switch_db -- better to extend existing DB objects.
Widgets: Add birthdays widget
Widgets: Add AJAX backend framework
style fixer: Try to pull page with fixed links from cache -- perhaps based on quick hash of header content? (unlikely)

Template funcs: Move all phpBB code to phpBB abstraction

- Cross-posting: Complete re-realisation: 
	- Cross-posted posts can now be edited
	- Cross-posted status is now checked properly, not via form fields
	- Follow-up posts in the forums now replace WordPress comments (TODO: Add option)
	- Comments via the WordPress comment box now go to the forum if the blog post is cross-posted
- Beginning to kill wpuAbs, and replacing with $phpbbForum. TODO: Don't kill $user unless absolutely necessary
- $phpbbForum handles the current state of the integration. $phpbbForum->enter() and $phpbbForum->leave() MUST be called properly before accessing phpBB features from WordPress
- phpBB is now always run, even in the dashboard. (It was anyway, but as a result of convoluted logic, and couldn't e relied upon)
- phpBB varialbes like phpbb_root_path and $phpEx are now consistently available, everywhere. The only ones missing are $user and $cache -- ge those via $phpbbForum or phpbbForum->enter()
- New comment and comments class load up phpBB comments into a format edible to WordPress
