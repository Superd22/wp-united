Files with relevant changes
---------------------------

	- install.xml -- only change is update to remove copy of wpu-plugin. See TODO 40.

	- wp-united/wp-functions.php. Updated. 
		-- TODO 5: (low priority) clean up branches, or check 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 for compatibility
		-- TODO 10: s/b unnecessary to handle blank usernames, this
			should be taking place in integration class.
		-- TODO 20: password hash line is uncommented, but passed in password is NOT plain text here. 
			Checked in WP-ntegration class -- password md5 hashing there is removed, so this MAY be plain text
			now. This will result in too many WP re-authentications. To investigate. Uncommented for now.
