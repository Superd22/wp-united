This document shows the status of bringing WP-United up-to-date with WP & phpBB latest versions.

Most tasks are now complete -- ready for release v0.6.5

1. Upgrade MODX template and packaging to phpBB latest -- DONE

2. 
	- install.xml -- only change is update to remove copy of wpu-plugin. See TODO 40.

	- wp-united/wp-functions.php. Updated. 
		-- TODO 5: (low priority) clean up branches, or check 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 for compatibility [Done]
		-- TODO 10: s/b unnecessary to handle blank usernames, this is taking place in integration class.
	-- TODO 30: See TODO 20 -- md5 hashing removed. OK for now using phpBB hashing. Need a way to restore back to WP passwords when WP-United uninstalled.


	- acp/acp_wp_united.php. TODO 40: Line 2879 $pluginPath: WP is now preventing directory traversal for plugins.
		However, this complicates installation for users. We already have too many users unable to read install instructions
		TODO 40: We try to copy the file automatically. If it fails, we need to give a link to download the file, then tell them
		to go to WP to upload it.
		
3. To remove phpBB2 compatibility as no longer supported

4. To check against about-to-be-released WP 2.8 DONE -- compatible with WP 2.8

5. Logout does not seem to be removing admin cookie correctly (can still get to wp-admin if you do not go via blog.php) -- to investigate.
